# Task List

1. ✅ Explore repository to understand dataset plugin structure and how to add a new dataset

2. ✅ Design integration plan for opencompass/AIME2025 with subsets I and II, including loader, schema, and evaluation (exact match)

3. ✅ Implement dataset loader(s) and registration in the framework

4. ✅ Implement evaluation/metric (exact match) if not already present and wire it up

5. ✅ Add configuration and documentation entries so the dataset can be selected via CLI

6. ✅ Test loading and evaluation with sample data (mock or small subset)
Smoke-tested loading from HF Hub. Returned 30 samples from AIME2025-I. Ready to run full evaluation.
